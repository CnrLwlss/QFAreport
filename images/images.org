* TODO Introduction [3/4]
  - [X] Section of P15
  - [X] Stripes plate images
  - [X] Comp Model Schematic
  - [ ] The competiton model as a correction to the logistic model
    - [ ] Put kn values and r,K values on the figure
    - [ ] Maybe even a b value?

* TODO Guessing [1/4]
  - [ ] Schematic of Imag Neighbour Guessing
  - [ ] kn Variation
    - [ ] Format
    - [ ] (Could use est params not Gaussian)
  - [X] Imag neigh fit to P15 (R5, C18)

* TODO Boundary Conditions / Corners [0/1]
  - To compare the one and two N_0 models.
  - [ ] top left 3x3 P15
    - [ ] Best Comp Model fit to P15
    - [ ] Best Comp Model BC fit to P15
    - [ ] label with obj funs just for edges or outmost two

* TODO P15 [2/6]
  - [X] Comp Fit whole plate
  - [X] Comp Fit zone (R5, C18)
  - [ ] Logistic model fit zone?
    - [ ] Logistic equivilant or QFA R (log or gen log)?
  - [ ] Ranks for best Comp fits
    - [ ] Make labels clearer
    - [ ] Remove lines through gene names
    - [ ] Separate HIS3 for edges or remove?
  - [ ] Ranks for different models
    - [ ] Remove log eq
    - [ ] Add general logistic model?
    - [ ] Remove lines through gene names
    - [ ] Add p-values
  - [ ] COV
    - [ ] MDR?
    - [ ] r?
    - [ ] comp BC, log, and gen log (not log eq?)
    - For the competition model all of the variance is contained in
      b. This is not true for the others.

* TODO Cross-plate validation [1/2]
  - [X] Stripes and filled simulation 3x3 (R9, C10).
  - [-] Change in rank between plates for each model w/ spearman's
    - [ ] How many genes to use in rank plots? Would definately have to be full
      page to use all as most have no reapeats (~ 384/2 in total (192)).
    - [ ] Comp model BC b
    - [ ] QFA log model or QFA gen log model? MDR or r?
    - [ ] Spearman's Rho
    - [X] p-values not possible do to lack of repeats

* TODO Genetic Algorithm [0/3]
  - [ ] Fit of 3x3 zone
    - [ ] Check that I was also fitting rather that fixing plate level params
    - [ ] Could redo with local min est params rather than chosen/random
  - [ ] Gradient fit of b with fixed plate level params to a
    simulation using params from one of the best Comp Model BC estimates for P15.
    - [ ] Check that all five simulation param sets were from the Comp
      Model BC (not no BC)
    - [ ] Tidy up

* TODO Discussion [0/0]
