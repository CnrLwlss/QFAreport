Fitness ranking from the competition model may be better than from the
logistic model (Will comparing stripes rankings reveal
anythin?). However, we cannot currently compare quantitatively fitness
estimates between plates using the competition model because we are
not finding global minima. Work has begun to develop a genetic
algorithm to do so. I am not convinced that this will succeed because,
for all of the current best parameter solutions, growth is
systematically overestimated when we move from the filled to striped
plate. This suggests an issue with the modelling approach and below I
suggest ways in which this could be improved. In any case, qualitative
cross-plate validation using order of fitness ranking may still be
better for the competition model.
