Fitness ranking from competition model fits may be better than from
logistic model fits (Will comparing stripes rankings reveal
anythin?). However, we cannot quantitatively compare fitness estimates
between plates because we are not finding global minima. Work has
begun to develop a genetic algorithm to do so. I am not convinced that
this will succeed because growth is systematically overestimated when
we move from the filled to striped plate for all of the current best
parameter solutions. This suggests an issue with the modelling
approach; below I suggest ways in which this could be improved. In
any case, qualitative cross-plate validation using order of fitness
ranking may still be better (for the competition model).


The first thing to notice about QFA data - from P15, the striped
plate, and the filled plate - is the characteristic endpoint in growth
on each plate. This holds whether a region contains many fast growing
cultures or not. This suggests a plate-level growth-limiting
effect. This could conceivably be an experimental limitation such as
the drying out of an agar plate over time. However, comparison of the
striped and filled data, shows that cultures tend to grow larger when
neighbours are removed and this suggests a direct interaction between
cultures. The strongest candidates are competition for nutrients and
growth limiting signalling such as ethanol poisoning. It is possible
that other growth limiting effects may exist and could confound any
attempt to fit a model which accounts for just one of these. It makes
sense to investigate each likely effect in turn to determine its
contribution and to start by validating the independent limit.

We have only studied data where cultures are grown in an array on
solid agar and growth cannot be assumed to be independent. Our model
says that nutrients can only be converted to cells and in the
independent limit all cultures starting with the same amount of
nutrients will reach the same final cell density. This ignores
metabolism and efficiency of converting nutrients to cells, which may
differ between strains. If present, differences in such effects could
account entirely for differences in final cell density. However, it is
unlikely to be the only effect, because this would not lead to the
observed characteristic endpoint in growth.
