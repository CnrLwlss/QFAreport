\subsection{\thesubsection~Model comparison using P15}
\label{sec:P15_fit}

I ran multiple fits of the competition model to P15
(Section~\ref{sec:P15_description}). Each fit used a fit of the
imaginary neighbour model (Figure~\ref{fig:imag_neigh_schematic}) to
make initial guesses of \(b_{i}\). I guessed other parameters as
described in Section~\ref{sec:initial_guess} and used separate
parameters for the initial amount of nutrients in edge and internal
cultures. The imaginary neighbour model itself requires initial
parameters and fits looped over combinations of values for initial
cell density \(C(0)\) and growth constant \(b\). I used five initial
values of \(C(0)\) ranging from \(N(0)\times\)10\(^{-5}\) to
\(N(0)\times\)10\(^{-3}\) in logspace (\(N(0)\) is approximately equal
to final cells) and a range of 14 different values for \(b\) and
\(b_{f}\) as described in Section~\ref{sec:guessing_b}. This made a
total of 70 fits. I show estimated competition model parameters for
the top two fits in Table~\ref{tab:P15_best_fit_params}. I selected
the best fits based on the fit to only internal cultures. Estimated
initial nutrient amounts agree fairly well between the top two fits
but there is disagreement in estimates of \(C(0)\) and nutrient
diffusion constant \(k\). It appears that the gradient method is not
finding a global minimum. However, \(b_{i}\) estimates were correlated
with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, \(\rho_{S} = 0.989\),
and had average mean absolute deviation, \(MAD = 1.56\). The mean
value of \(b\) for the best fit was 44.4 so this disagreement is
relatively small.

For all comparisons between the top four fits, \(\rho_{S}\) ranges
from 0.922 to 0.995 and \(b\) MAD ranges from 1.56 to 6.90. I
discarded the 5th best fit, which has less agreement, because, unlike
the other fits, it estimated \(N_{I}(0)\) > \(N_{E}(0)\). When
comparing this outlier with the top four fits, \(\rho_{S}\) is above
0.930, but \(b_{i}\) are more affected, with a maximum MAD of
13.29. Despite not finding a global minimum, the best competition
model estimates of \(b_{i}\) agree well enough with each to allow
meaningful comparison with logistic model parameter estimates.

For the best fit of the competition model to P15
(Figure~\ref{fig:comp_fit_plate}), estimated cell amounts (blue) match
the data well across the entire plate. A high nutrient diffusion
constant, \(k\), is fit, such that nutrients diffuse readily and
nutrient timecourses are similar across local areas of the plate. When
comparing objective function values over the plate
(Table~\ref{tab:P15_obj_fun}), the logistic model values (smaller) are
slightly better. The total objective function value for internal
cultures is also slightly better for the logistic model (0.155)
compared to the competition model (0.194). However, the logistic model
used 1152 parameters to achieve this, whereas the competition model
only used 387. The better comparison is with internal cultures because
edge cultures have higher noise. To make objective function
comparisons fair, I converted logistic model parameters to competition
model parameters by (\ref{eq:conversion}) and resimulated both models
using CANS.

The boxed 3x3 zone in Figure~\ref{fig:comp_fit_plate} is replotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:P15_zone_fit}, with fits of the competition model
(solid), imaginary neighbour guess (dashed), and logistic model
(red). The zone contains more fast growing cultures than is typical
for the plate, so competition effects might be greater than
average. The logistic model was fit using the QFA R package
\citep{qfa2016}. The fit of the initial guess is typical for the
plate; timecourses for some cultures, such as the bottom-left, are not
well fit. However, the guess fulfils its purpose by allowing a good
fit to be made when used to initialise parameters of the competition
model. The objective function of the logistic and competition model
fit is similar for most cultures in the zone. However, for the centre
and centre-right fast growing cultures, the competition model has much
lower objective function values and appears to fit much better than
the logistic model. The total objective function value for the zone is
lowest for the competition model: 44.06 vs 68.38 (values scaled by
\(10^{4}\)). The logistic model must provide the better fit for other
areas of the plate. Overall, the quality of fit is similar for both
models.

\subsection{\boldmath \thesubsection~Correlation or \(r\) estimates between models \unboldmath}

To compare model estimates, I converted competition model \(b_{i}\) to
logistic model \(r_{i}\) using (\ref{eq:conversion}). I took the
median \(r\) for each deletion for both the competition and logistic
model. I took the median, rather than mean, to reduce the effect of
outliers that may results from cross-contamination of strains or
inoculation of dead cells. Figure~\ref{fig:P15_correlations} shows
correlations, between models, of \(r_{i}\) estimates for each culture
(black) and of median \(r\) estimates for each deletion (red). The
distribution for cultures is split into two distinct correlated
groups. This is due to a gap in the distribution of logistic model
\(r\) at around \(r\) = 4. There is no such gap in the distribution of
competition model \(r\). The groups only overlap for medium values of
competition model \(r\). The larger group, with lower logistic model
\(r\), is correlated with competition model \(r\) with gradient close
to one. However, competition model estimates were lower for almost all
cultures. In the outlying group, competition model \(r\) varies more
steeply with logistic model \(r\).

There are several extreme outlying cultures (black). The QFA R package
uses heuristic checks to correct for confounding between \(r\) and
\(K\) estimates for slow growing cultures. These are required because
cultures are fit individually and slow growing cultures contain more
noise. For the eight slow growing outliers on the left axis, the
checks set \(r\) = 0. The two outliers with very high logistic \(r\)
are repeats of \textit{rad50\(\Delta\)} and
\textit{est1\(\Delta\)}. They have escaped the heuristic checks and
exhibit the confounding effect between \(r\) and \(K\).

In the distribution of the medians (red), most deletions fall inside
the main group of cultures with lower logistic \(r\). There are also
several deletions with high competition model \(r\) that fall inside
the outlying group (top-right). A significant number of deletions lie
in the region between the two groups, meaning that repeats of these
cultures are split between the groups. This worsens the correlation of
\(r\) ranks between deletions compared to cultures.  Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient, \(\rho_{S}\), measures the correlation
between rank orders of two variables. A monotonic function has a value
of 1 or -1. Other correlations fall between these values. For cultures
\(\rho_{S}\) = 0.731, for deletions \(\rho_{S}\) =
0.497.
% (\(\rho_{S}\) is improved when comparing competition model
% \(b\), or equivalently \(MDR\), with logistic model \(MDR\)

\subsection{\thesubsection~Comparison of fitness ranking}

%%%% Write here

In Figure~\ref{fig:comp_vs_log_ranking}, I compare deletions on P15
ranked by competition model \(b\), logistic model \(r\), and logistic
model \(MDR\). The fittest deletions are at the top. For each fitness
measure, I took the median estimate from repeats of each deletion. I
used the QFA R package to infer logistic model \(r\) and \(MDR\), and
used \(b\) from the best fit of the competition model
(Section~\ref{sec:P15_fit}). Competition model \(b\), \(r\), and
\(MDR\) rank are equivalent (see
Section~\ref{sec:parameter_conversion}) so it is not necessary to
convert \(b\) to compare rankings.

Logistic model \(r\) and \(MDR\) rankings agree for all but two
deletions: \textit{rad50\(\Delta\)} and \textit{est1\(\Delta\)}. These
are the same deletions as the two outliers with high logistic model
\(r\) values in Figure~\ref{fig:P15_correlations}. When \(MDR\) is
calculated (\ref{eq:MDR_MDP}a), the confounding between \(r\) and
\(K\) is corrected for and the rank of these deletions agrees well
with competition model \(b\) rank. As a result, Spearman's
\(\rho_{S}\) is higher for competition model \(b\) and logistic model
\(MDR\) (0.635) than it is for competition model \(b\) and logistic
model \(r\) (0.497). When comparing competition model \(b\) rank with
logistic model \(MDR\) rank, there is good agreement between the
extreme rankings but middle rankings appear almost inverted. There is
also a disagreement of 13 places in the rank of the neutral deletion
\textit{his3\(\Delta\)} (bold).

\subsection{\thesubsection~Evaluating the treatment of boundaries}
\label{sec:treatment_of_boundaries}

I had seen that objective function values were large for edge cultures
compared to internal cultures (Table~\ref{tab:P15_obj_fun}). To
evaluate the treatment of boundaries, I also fit the one \(N(0)\)
parameter competition model to P15 using the same method as for the
two \(N(0)\) parameter model (see Section~\ref{sec:P15_fit}). Fits
appear similar in quality for both models
(Figure~\ref{fig:P15_corner}) and average objective function values
for the entire plate are very similar
(Table~\ref{tab:corner}). Objective function values for cultures next
to an edge culture are improved with the two \(N(0)\) model and
internal cultures were better fit overall. Interestingly, fits of the
edge cultures are actually worse in the two \(N(0)\) model. These
cultures are dominated by noise due to reflections from plate walls
which is why they are discarded from final estimates. However, the
edge cultures must be included in the objective function when fitting
the competition model. Despite this deficit, the two \(N(0)\) model
has increased the goodness of fit to internal cultures by collectively
fitting all cultures.

\subsection{\thesubsection~Comparison of Variation in Fitness Estimates}
\label{sec:cross_plate_validation}

% Use repeats on plate 15 (6 per deletion) more (14) for HIS3 to
% calculate coefficient of variation (COV) of estimated r or MDR.

In Figure~\ref{fig:COV}, I compare coefficients of variation (COVs)
for competition model estimates of \(b\) and logistic model estimates
of \(r\) between repeats of each deletion on P15. I chose to compare
\(b\) and \(r\), rather than \(b\) and \(MDR\), because both
parameters are growth constants in the competition and logistic models
respectively. Regardless, COVs for \(MDR\) (not shown) are very
similar to COVs for \(r\). The precision of fitness estimates is of
interest both as a test of the model and because it affects the power
to infer genetic interactions. If we assume that biological variation
in fitness between repeats of the same strain is small, then the
better model should estimate the fitness of strains more precisely,
regardless of where repeats are grown on the plate.

Deletions in Figure~\ref{fig:COV} are arranged from left to right
according to competition model \(b\) ranking, with the fastest growing
deletion on the left. The competition model has a smaller COV for 36
out of 50 deletions. However, the logistic model has a smaller COV for
the 11 fastest growers (according to \(b\) ranking). Comparing with
Figure~\ref{fig:P15_correlations}, median values for these deletions
(red) appear in the upper right of both groups of cultures (black),
not in the gap inbetween. \(b\) COV tends to be smaller than \(r\) COV
at smaller values of \(b\), where repeats are likely to divided
between the groups (as indicated by the positions of medians inbetween
groups). The slowest growers tend to have greater COV for both models,
which is likely due to the greater effect of noise on cell density
estimates in repeats of these deletions.

\subsection{\thesubsection~Cross-plate validation}

I used the Stripes and Filled plates experiment
(Figure~\ref{fig:stripes_images}) to conduct cross plate calibration
and validation of the competition model. As for P15
(Section~\ref{sec:P15_fit}), I ran multiple fits of the competition
model for each plate. Due to the greater number of timepoints in the
data, I fit to cell densities at 15 evenly spaced timepoints taken
from a spline of the observed data to increase the speed of fitting
(see Section~\ref{sec:solving_comp}). I used a greater range of
\(C(0)\) guesses than for P15: 10 values ranging from
\(N(0)\times\)10\(^{-7}\) to \(N(0)\times\)10\(^{-1}\) in logspace. I
made this decision due to the higher inoculum densities used in these
plates and as a result of discussion with Herrmann and Lawless, who
had suggested, based on recent work, that heterogeneity exists within
individual cultures such that only a small number of cell lines
contribute significantly to final populations. Again, each fit used
the imaginary neighbour model to make initial guesses of \(b_{i}\)
with 14 different initial \(b\) guesses for each \(C(0)\) guess
(Section~\ref{sec:guessing_b}). This made a total of 140 fits to each
plate. I guessed other parameters as described in
Section~\ref{sec:initial_guess} and used separate parameters for the
initial amount of nutrients in edge and internal cultures.

The experiment, described in detail in
Section~\ref{sec:stripes_description}, is designed to test for
competition effects. I received the data from E. Holstein (April 2016)
in personal communications. The strains in the Stripes plate
(Figure~\ref{fig:stripes_images}a) are inoculated in the same
positions on the Filled plate (Figure~\ref{fig:stripes_images}b). I
took the competition model parameter estimates for the Filled plate
and simulated the Stripes plate by setting \(b\) to zero for locations
in the gaps on this plate. I compared the resulting timecourses with
the Stripes cell observations
(Figure~\ref{fig:stripes_validation}). If the competition model
corrects for differences between the plates perfectly, then the
simulated timecourses (blue dashes) should fit closely to the Stripes
data (blue crosses). I found that the competition model overcorrects
for competition; simulated cell densities are higher than observations
across the plate. In contrast, the logistic model makes no adjustment
between plates and would underestimate observed cell densities by a
similar amount. There are some issues with the data set. For instance,
the top right culture in Figure~\ref{fig:stripes_validation} does not
grow and may have been inoculated with dead cells. However, these
mistakes are unlikely to have caused the systematic overcorrection
that is observed. Data for empty cultures on the Stripes plate (blue
crosses, middle column) is just noise and I excluded these timecourses
from the objective function when fitting.

The inferred parameters for the best competition model fits to both
plates are shown in Table~\ref{tab:Stripes_and_Filled_params}. Both
plates used the same inoculum density and formula of agar so I did not
expect plate level parameters to vary between plates. However, there
is significant disagreement in all parameters, indicating that the
competition model is not working correctly. There was also more
disagreement in the top fits for each plate than was the case for P15,
which used a lower inoculum density. Estimates for the five best fits
to the Filled plate (Table~\ref{tab:Stripes_and_Filled_params}) are
only consistent for initial nutrient densities. Despite this, they all
overestimated growth when used to simulate the Stripes
plate. Disagreement between the best estimates was worse still for the
Stripes plate (not shown).

% Due to the disagreement between competition model estimates for the
% same plates, I was motivated to explore alternative strategies for
% fitting that might return global minima.
To test the viability of using a genetic algorithm to evolve
plate-level parameter candidates and evaluating these using a gradient
method, I took parameter estimates from the five best fits for P15,
and simulated full plate timecoureses of cell observations with 15
timepoints. I added a small amount of random noise to each timecourse
to replicate real data. I then fixed the plate level parameters to the
true values and fit the competition model just for
\(b_{i}\). \(b_{i}\) were recovered well even in the worst instance
(Figure~\ref{fig:comp_fit_fixed_plate_level}). Estimates are worse for
slow growing cultures which are more affected by noise.
