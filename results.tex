\subsection{\thesubsection~Competition Model Fitting to P15}

I ran multiple fits of the competition model to P15. Each fit used the
imaginary neighbour model to make initial parameter guesses (see
Section~\ref{sec:guessing_b}. The imaginary neighbour model itself
requires initial parameters and fits looped over combinations of
values for initial cell density \(C(0)\) and growth constant \(b\). I
used five initial values of \(C(0)\) ranging from
\(N(0)\times\)10\(^{-5}\) to \(N(0)\times\)10\(^{-3}\) in logspace
(\(N(0)\) is approximately equal to final cells) and a range of 14
different values for \(b\) as described in
Section~\ref{sec:guessing_b}. This made a total of 70 fits. I show
estimated competition model parameters for the two best fits in
Table~\ref{tab:P15_best_fit_params}. Estimated initial nutrient
amounts agree fairly well between but there is disagreement in
estimates of \(C(0)\) and (nutrient diffusion constant) \(k\). It
appears that the gradient method is not finding a global
minimum. However, \(b_{i}\) estimates were correlated with Spearman's
rank correlation coefficient, \(\rho_{S} = 0.989\), and had average
mean absolute deviation, \(MAD = 1.56\). The mean of \(b_{i}\)
estimates for the best fit was 44.4.

For all comparisons between the top four fits \(\rho_{S}\) ranges from
0.922 to 0.995 and \(b\) MAD ranges from 1.56 to 6.90. I discarded the
5th best fit, which has less agreement, because, unlike the other
fits, it estimated \(N_{I}(0)\) > \(N_{E}(0)\). When comparing to the
top four fits, \(\rho_{S}\) was above 0.930 but \(b\) values were more
affected with a maximum MAD of 13.29.

Despite not finding a global minimum, the best competition model
estimates agree well enough with each other to make meaningful
comparison with logistic model estimates.

      two competition model fits to P15.} Spearman's rank correlation
