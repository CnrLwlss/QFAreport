    b-guess to be supplied to fix the faster growing neighbour. (I
    iterated through cell ratios. I iterated through a range of b
    guesses supplied at the plate level; running a different script
    with a \(C_{0}\) guess, \(b_{guess}\). It would probably have been
    better iterate through a list of b-guess values for each culture
    and choosing the estimated b value from the best fit of each
    culture. Guessing time is currently about four minutes which is
    fast compared to fitting which takes approximately three
    hours. However, this is unlikely to stop us from encountering
    local minima when we fit the Competition Model.}

Scripts were run with combinations of the following values.
cellratios = np.logspace(-3, -5, num=5)
fittype = ["imagneigh", "logeq"]
zerokn = [True, False]

Each script looped through the following array of b values which were
supplied to the initial guesser and used at the plate level.

for b-guess in [35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 95, 100, 150]:

Each b-guess value is used to guess a complete set of b parameters for
every culture in the plate. Each of these parameter sets is then used
as an initial guess to Competition Model fitting. For the 13 b-guesses
we must run 13 Competition Model fits. It would be better and more
efficient to loop through the b-guesses at the culture level. Each
culture still undergoes imaginary neighbour guessing with each of the
13 b-guess values, but now, for each culture, we choose just the b
estimate from the best of the 13 fits. This will produce one set of b
guesses which should be superior to any of the guesses attained when
iterating through b-guess at the plate level. Then we only need to fit
the Competition Model to 1 guess rather than 13. This will reduce the
number of scripts that need to be run in parallel, or the use of a
finer grid over \(C_{0}\), and should make convergence
faster. However, if using a gradient method we are still likely to
encounter local minima from these guesses. Instead, this improvement
could be considered when developing a genetic algorithm (if initial
guesses are required) or if fitting using a brute force method with a
fine grid of fixed plate level parameters. We will see later that with
true plate level parameters fixed we can recover good estimates for b
using a gradient method. It may be possible to evolve candidates of
plate level parameters, fix these, and minimise using the current
gradient method.
