The bacteria \textit{Eschericia Coli} and yeast \textit{Saccharomyces
  cerevisae} are unicellular organisms studied as a model prokaryote
and eukaryote respectively. They grow in colonies, where cells may (be
clones originating from a single cell or) belong to different genetic
strains originating from different individual cells. In favourable
conditions, growth is exponential and this makes growth rate a major
component of fitness; faster growing strains quickly come to dominate
the population. For unicellular organisms, growth rate is equal to
cell cycle progression rate. Evolutionary pressure has led to rapidly
dividing organisms with a compact genome of essential genes. These
genes have been conserved in other species over billions of years of
evolution. The eukaryote \textit{S. cerevisae}, is particularly useful
for the study of other eukaryotes such as humans.

The growth rate of microbial organisms is measurable and is often used
to determine fitness. In experiments, cell cultures are commonly grown
in two types of medium. In spot atests (phenotypic array), cultures are pinned or
inoculated onto the surface of a solid agar containing nutrients. In
liquid culture assays, cultures are mixed in a liquid medium
containing nutrients. In both cases cultures are incubated and growth
is observed. Identical strains grow differently between the two
mediums and disagreement between fitness estimates is currently an
issue. I did not focus on this issue and used data exclusively from
experiments using solid agar.
