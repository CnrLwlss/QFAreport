% Could introduce model organisms first
The bacteria \textit{Eschericia Coli} and yeast \textit{Saccharomyces
  cerevisae} are single-celled microbial organims studied as a model
prokaryote and eukaryote respectively. In favourable conditions,
microbial organisms (such as these) divide exponentially and form
large colonies comprising many individual cells. Cells may be clones
originating from a single cell or (more often in nature) belong to
different genetic strains originating from different individual
cells. For a strain to be successful and dominate a population, it
must (use nutrients efficiently and) divide faster than other strains
in the colony. This has led to the evolution of rapid cell division
and compact genomes in these organisms. \textit{E. Coli} and
\textit{S.  cerevisae} are useful as model organisms because many of
the genes in their compacted genomes have improtant functions which
have been conserved over billions of years of evolution and have
anologues in other species. The eukaryote \textit{S. cerevisae}, is
particularly useful for the study of other eukaryotes such as humans.
