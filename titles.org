* TODO Introduction [0/9]
  - [ ] Explain QFA
  - [ ] In contrast SGA fits no growth curves (but is
    quantitative. Takes a number from cell density measurement at the
    time the experiment is stopped.)
  - [ ] Explain here or in the method the previous work of addinall and the
  - [ ] Temperature and conditional mutants
  - [ ] Taken out of incubator and photographed
  - [ ] Images analysed and intensity of cultures used as a proxy for cell density
  - [ ] QFA R packages assumes independence and
    - [ ] fits logistic and generalised logistic growth curves
    - [ ] r not equivlent between these two models. Uses other fitness estimates
    - [ ] MDR, MDP and MDR*MDP
    - [ ] Fixes C_0 for all cultures.
    - [ ] Has heuristic checkes for slow growing cultures due
  - [ ] Cannot measure the amount of nutrients
  - [ ] In many datasets (e.g. P15) the initial cell density is below the
    resolution of the imaging analysis.



* TODO Method [0/7]
  - [ ] Data procecessing with Colonyzer.
  - [ ] P15 cdc13-1 background mutation at 27C Adinall 2011
    - [ ] Repeats (Inoculated from different liquid cultures? - could
      have differentiated?)
    - [ ] Inoculation density?
    - [ ] Noise
    - [ ] Innoculation of HIS3 in edge locations
    - [ ] Noise in edge cultures and greater associated area of
      nutrients. (Remove from model)
  - [ ] Stripes and Filled data sets
    - [ ] Validated against this experiment.
    - [ ] Low numbers of repeats (none for most cultures)
    - [ ] What is background mutation if there is one?
    - [ ]
    - [ ] Different strains innoculated in columns with gaps left in one plate
    - [ ] Gaps filled with other strains on a separate plate (How do these differ?)
    - [ ] Identical strains on both plates inoculated from the same
      liquid cultures.
  - [ ] Simulation and Fitting with a Gradient method.
    - [ ] odeint
    - [ ] scipy.optimize.minimize
    - [ ] Fit C_0, N_0, and kn (plate level) and b (culture level) collectively
    - [ ] Scaling of C_0
  - [ ] Logistic equivalent model
  - [ ] Speeding up the solver
    - [ ] 5x speed up by vectorizing operations using numpy. Still too slow.
    - [ ] Wrote models in SBML using libSBML
    - [ ] Species, parameters, and reaction equations are
      automatically generated for any dimension plate.
    - [ ] Flexibility to change the model defining a new reaction or
      rate equations including new species. Permits reactions within a
      cell or diffusion between horizontal and horizontal and vertical
      neighbours (could technically be reactions other than
      diffusion).
    - [ ] Explain how a model is defined and
    - [ ] dealing with boundaries
      - [ ] P15 data has the same strain around the whole edge. Have
        access to a greater area of nutrinients becasue there is a
        zone around the edge of the agar where no cultures are
        inoculated. This differs for each side depending on how
        centrally the cultures have been inoculated onto the plate. An
        again greater are of the agar belongs to corners cultures. We
        treat all edge cultures the same and use a second N_0 in the
        model. We will discard edge cultures from our final results but aim to increase the accuracy of estimates of inner cultures b
      - [ ] More nutrients, same starting concentration, same reaction area/volume
      - [ ] Could have
  - [ ] Python implementation
    - [ ] "empties" to remove empty c_meas from the objective
      function. Not simpy enough to set b to zero as would bias C_0
      estimates.
