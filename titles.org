* TODO Introduction [0/10]
  - [ ] SGA, QFA, and liquid cultures.
  - [ ] Explain QFA
    - [ ] Temperature and conditional mutants
    - [ ] Inoculated with different strains (with deletion and querry)
      often with repeats. Rectangular array on agar. Many plates in a
      genome-wide screen. How many per plate?
    - [ ] Grown in an incubator and taken out to be photographed at
      different timepoints.
    - [ ] Images analysed and intensity of cultures used as a proxy for
      cell density using Colonyzer.
    - [ ] QFA R packages assumes independence
      - [ ] fits logistic and generalised logistic growth curves
      - [ ] r not equivlent between these two models. Uses other fitness estimates
      - [ ] MDR, MDP and MDR*MDP
    - [ ] In many datasets (e.g. P15) the initial cell density is below the
      resolution of the imaging analysis and must be inferred.
      - [ ] Fixes C_0 for all cultures (rather than any fitting?).
      - [ ] Makes heuristic checks for slow growing cultures because
	noise confounds r and K.
    - [ ] In contrast SGA fits no growth curves (but is
      quantitative. Takes one number from a cell density measurement
      partway through growth when the experiments is stopped (aiming to
      still be in the exponential phase?).)
    - [ ] Cannot measure the amount of nutrients directly.
      - [ ] Nutrients (sugars, nitrogen, etc.) in QFQ agars are of a
	standard composition, designed to reduce the excess of any single
	nutrient (check QFA paper and cite).
      - [ ] Identity of the limiting nutrient known? Nitrogen is only
	used to build molecules for new cells, whereas sugars are also
	used for metabolism.
	- Could for instance add sugar at periods throughout the
          experiment or use a different composition so that the limiting
          nutrient is always the same.
  - [ ] Explain here or in the methods the previous work of addinall
    and the p15 data set? - (also mention telomere and importance in
    aging?)
  - [ ] Use of QFA in infering genetic interaction, drug screening, etc.
  - [ ] Why we belive there may be competition effects
    - [ ] Could introduce stripes dataset and p15
  - [ ] Explain our model - Should I be doing this here or in the
    methods? I could just introduce mass action kinetics
    - [ ] Network diffusion
    - [ ] Mass action kinetics
    - [ ] Reduction to independent limit which is equivalent to the
      logistic model.
      - [ ] Validity of approximation / fractal kinetics
      - [ ] Why deterministic and not stochastic?
      - [ ] Plate level and culture level parameters
      - [ ] Boundary conditions and two N_0s
  - [ ] Viewed as a correction to the independent model
  - [ ] Introduce SBML?
  - [ ] Gradient fitting and genetic algorithms
  - [ ] Imaginary neighbour model and guesssing

# I think it might be best to get all of the figures I want for the
# results FIRST and then just explain how I got them here.


Describe data
- cells observable; nutrients hidden
- C_0 below level of detection

  - [ ] Model organism can tell us about other species
  - [ ] Growth rate as a proxy for fitness
    - [ ] Explain why is this is suitible for microbial species
  - [ ] Fitness/health tells us about genetic interaction and drug
    response
  - [ ] Describe spot tests and liquid cultures
    - [ ] Mention disagreement in fitness estimates between growth mediums
  - [ ] Introduce SGA and QFA
    - [ ] Why hightroughput? same conditions/more of the genome
    - [ ] Why quantitative is better
  - [ ] Describe QFA in more detail
    - [ ] Describe the experiment design/procedure
      - Dilute or more concentrated inoculation
    - [ ] Describe the data that is produced and processing with Colonyzer
    - [ ] Describe current analysis with the logistic model and QFA R
    - [ ] Previous results (Adinall) and follow up (Holstein &
      Clark) - Check which results were actually followed up.
  - [ ] Explain the motivation for a nutrient diffusion model and
    current support for an effect on results
    - [ ] At the same time, introduce P15 and the Stripes and Filled
      plates but wait until the methods to describe in more detail
    - [ ] Briefly mention alternative hypotheses or wait until
      discussion? I will mention metabolism when I explain the
      approximations of the competition model.
  - [ ] Describe previous attempts to correct for competition and how
    our approach differs
  - [ ] Introduce the Competition model
    - [ ] Mass action kinetics and network diffusion
      - Cells observed; nutrients hidden
      - Plate and culture level parameters
      - What can we measure? kn? C_0 often below detectable level in
        QFA - write here or elsewhere?
    - [ ] Justify approximations
      - [ ] Mass action kinetics
      - [ ] Coarse grid diffusion
      - [ ] Deterministic not stochastic
      - [ ] All nutrients are converted to cells
	- [ ] All cultures starting with the same amount of nutrients
          end with the same amount of cells.
    - [ ] Reduces to the logistic equivalent model in the independent limit
      - [ ] Can be seen as a correction for nutrient diffusion
    - [ ] Briefly explain what we plan to do with the model
      - Fit to data to determine to see if we can improve
  - [ ] Explain the Imaginary neighbour model - Really do this here or
    in methods? I am beginning to think methods. Seems like results
    for this would useually go in the appendix.
    - [ ] I have come up with a model for quickly fitting individual
      cultures to get appoximate estimates of b.
    - [ ] It is based on the competition model we already have.
    - [ ] Places imaginary fast growing and empty cultures next to the
      culture of interest.
    - [ ] We use the same number, n, of each of these. This could be
      eight in total to represent, for instance, 4 fast growing
      neighbours or 4 slow growing neighbours.
    - [ ] N_0 can be inferred from the data final cell amounts
    - [ ] The number of neighbours which we imagine is determined by
      how far above the final cell amount the initial amount of
      nutrients is.
    - [ ] Have real data for the culture of interest
    - [ ] Fix N_0 and the growth of both neighbours. We have to use a
      grid of fixed C_0 values and take the best fit.
    - [ ] Allow k1, k2 and b for the culture of interest to vary.
    - [ ] We can also try different values of b_fast for fits of each
      culture.
    - [ ] Main difference is in having two kn's (k1 and k2) which we
      allow to vary freely.
    - Performance will have to wait until the results.
#  - [ ] Validation data from spot tests - Explain here, in the methods or in the results?

* TODO Method [0/9]
  - [ ] Data procecessed with Colonyzer.
  - [ ] P15 cdc13-1 background mutation at 27C Adinall 2011
    - [ ] Repeats (Inoculated from different liquid cultures? - could
      have differentiated?)
    - [ ] Inoculation density?
    - [ ] Noise
    - [ ] Innoculation of HIS3 in edge locations
    - [ ] Noise in edge cultures and greater associated area of
      nutrients. (Remove from model)
  - [ ] Stripes and Filled data sets
    - [ ] Validated against this experiment.
    - [ ] Low numbers of repeats (none for most cultures)
    - [ ] What is background mutation if there is one?
    - [ ]
    - [ ] Different strains innoculated in columns with gaps left in one plate
    - [ ] Gaps filled with other strains on a separate plate (How do these differ?)
    - [ ] Identical strains on both plates inoculated from the same
      liquid cultures.
  - [ ] Simulation and Fitting with a Gradient method.
    - [ ] odeint and least squares
    - [ ] scipy.optimize.minimize
    - [ ] Fit C_0, N_0, and kn (plate level) and b (culture level) collectively
    - [ ] Scaling of C_0
  - [ ] Logistic equivalent model
  - [ ] Speeding up the solver
    - [ ] 5x speed up by vectorizing operations using numpy. Still too slow.
    - [ ] Wrote models in SBML using libSBML solved with
      libroadrunner. Could also solve and fit in Copasi.
    - [ ] Species, parameters, and reaction equations are
      automatically generated for any dimension plate.
    - [ ] Flexibility to change the model defining a new reaction or
      rate equations including new species. Permits reactions within a
      cell or diffusion between horizontal and horizontal and vertical
      neighbours (could technically be reactions other than
      diffusion).
    - [ ] Explain how a model is defined and
    - [ ] dealing with boundaries
      - [ ] P15 data has the same strain around the whole edge. Have
        access to a greater area of nutrinients becasue there is a
        zone around the edge of the agar where no cultures are
        inoculated. This differs for each side depending on how
        centrally the cultures have been inoculated onto the plate. An
        again greater are of the agar belongs to corners cultures. We
        treat all edge cultures the same and use a second N_0 in the
        model. We will discard edge cultures from our final results but aim to increase the accuracy of estimates of inner cultures b
      - [ ] More nutrients, same starting concentration, same reaction area/volume
      - [ ] Could have
  - [ ] Python implementation
    - [ ] "empties" to remove empty c_meas from the objective
      function. Not simpy enough to set b to zero as would bias C_0
      estimates.
  - [ ] Splining using python for data wihth manyu timepoints
  - [ ] Genetic algorithm
    - [ ] hierarchical
    - [ ] insypred
    - [ ] multiprocessing
