* TODO Introduction Grand Plan [0/12]
  - [ ] Describe yeast/bacterial growth
  - [ ] Model organism can tell us about other species (humans)
  - [ ] Growth rate as a proxy for fitness
    - [ ] Explain why this is suitible for microbial species
  - [ ] Describe spot tests and liquid cultures
    - [ ] Mention disagreement in growth estimates between growth mediums
  - [ ] Introduce SGA and QFA - (can leave contrast until I have
    explained QFA in more detail)
    - [ ] Solid agar; high-troughput; quantitative; can study whole genomes
    - [ ] Explain how fitness of genetic strains can tell us about
      genetic interactions and drug responses.
      - Give examples of this use and emphasise benefits to human health.
      - [ ] Say that Adinall studied genes involved in telomere
        stabilitly because of their links with cancer and aging and
        this could have impacts for humans but do not go into any more
        detail about telomeres, cancer, drugs, etc., (won't have room
        and don't really care for this study).
  - [ ] Describe QFA in more detail - "I study QFA data ->"
    - [ ] Describe the experiment design/procedure
      - Dilute or more concentrated inoculation
    - [ ] Describe the data that is produced and processing with Colonyzer
    - [ ] Describe current analysis with THE LOGISTIC MODEL and QFA R
      - [ ] Write the logistic model equation
      - [ ] I mention MDR so explain this as well
    - [ ] Contrast QFA with SGA
    - [ ] Previous results (?) and follow up (Holstein &
      Clark) - Check which results were actually followed up.
  - [ ] Explain the motivation for a nutrient diffusion model and
    current support for an effect
    - [ ] At the same time, introduce P15 and the Stripes and Filled
      plates but wait until the methods to describe in these
      experiments in more detail.
    - [ ] Briefly mention alternative hypotheses (e.g. singal,
      metabolism) or wait until discussion? I will mention metabolism
      when I explain the approximations of the competition model. I
      think that I should probably mention signal and metabolism here
      if I have room.
  - [ ] Describe previous attempts to correct for competition and how
    our approach differs
  - [ ] Describe previous attempts to model diffusion (Diffusion
    equation model of Reo and Korolev 2014)
    - I am planning to talk about this in the discussion so could
      introduce here and also explain why we need a less detailed
      model (limits of computational power).
  - [ ] Introduce the Competition model
    - [ ] Mass action kinetics and network diffusion
      - Reaction and rate equations
      - Cells observed; nutrients hidden
      - Explain the plate and culture level parameters.
      - Explain what is measureable and what we must infer. kn? C_0
        often below detectable level in QFA - write here or elsewhere?
        We explain how we infer N_0 when we talk about initial guessing.
    - [ ] Justify approximations
      - [ ] Mass action kinetics
      - [ ] Coarse grid diffusion - What is the best name for this?
      - [ ] Deterministic not stochastic
      - [ ] All nutrients are converted to cells
	- [ ] Implies all cultures starting with the same amount of
          nutrients end with the same amount of cells. ->
          Mention metabolism
    - [ ] Reduces to the logistic equivalent model in the independent limit
      - [ ] Can be seen as a correction for nutrient diffusion
      - [ ] Conversion equations (Not planning to inculude the full
        derivation - Link to Conor's blog?)
      - [ ] With same plate level parameters b rank is equivalent to r
        rank (also MDR and MDR*MDP) and K is constant.
  - [ ] Briefly explain what we plan to do with the model
    - Fit to data to try to estimate growth parameters more reliably
  - [ ] Short summary
    - More reliable measurement of growth parameters ->
    - More reliable fitness estimates ->
    - Better prediction of genetic interaction or drug response

I could also say - We hope that a model could be used to
compare/improve experimental design by simulation of
e.g. randomisation / SGA v QFA and dilute vs concentrated. I could
just say this in one line but I imagine that the above will already
take a fair amount of space and we haven't found that yet. Perhaps at
the end of the discussion.

* TODO Imaginary Neighbour Model [0/1]
  # I am not really sure where to write about this, at the end of the
  # introduction or in the methods. I think it needs its own section
  # somewhere.
  - [ ] Explain the Imaginary neighbour model
    - [ ] I have come up with a model for quickly fitting individual
      cultures to get appoximate estimates of b.
    - [ ] It is based on the competition model we already have.
    - [ ] Places imaginary fast growing and empty cultures next to the
      culture of interest.
    - [ ] We use the same number, n, of each of these. This could be
      eight in total to represent, for instance, 4 fast growing
      neighbours or 4 slow growing neighbours.
    - [ ] N_0 can be inferred from the data final cell amounts
    - [ ] The number of neighbours which we imagine is determined by
      how far above the final cell amount the initial amount of
      nutrients is.
    - [ ] Have real data for the culture of interest
    - [ ] Fix N_0 and the growth of both neighbours. We have to use a
      grid of fixed C_0 values and take the best fit.
    - [ ] Allow k1, k2 and b for the culture of interest to vary.
    - [ ] We can also try different values of b_fast for fits of each
      culture.
    - [ ] Main difference is in having two kn's (k1 and k2) which we
      allow to vary freely.
    - Performance of imaginary neighbour guessing will have to wait
      until the results.
