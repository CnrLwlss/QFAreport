* TODO Introduction [7/13]
  - [X] Describe yeast/bacterial growth
  - [X] Model organism can tell us about other species (humans)
  - [X] Yeast and humans are eukaryotes
  - [X] Growth rate as a proxy for fitness
    - [X] Explain why this is suitible for microbial species
  - [X] Describe growth mediums (spot tests and liquid cultures)
    - [X] Mention disagreement in growth estimates between growth mediums
  - [-] Introduce SGA and QFA - (can leave contrast until I have
    explained QFA in more detail)
    - [X] Solid agar; high-troughput; quantitative; can study whole genomes
    - [X] Explain how fitness of genetic strains can tell us about
      genetic interactions and drug responses.
    - [ ] Give examples of this use and emphasise benefits to human health.
    - [ ] Say that Adinall studied genes involved in telomere
      stabilitly because of their links with cancer and aging and
      this could have impacts for humans but do not go into any more
      detail about telomeres, cancer, drugs, etc., (won't have room
      and don't really care for this study).
  - [-] Describe QFA in more detail - "I study QFA data ->"
    - [X] Describe the experiment design/procedure
      - Dilute or more concentrated inoculation
    - [X] Describe the data that is produced and processing with Colonyzer
    - [X] Describe current analysis with THE LOGISTIC MODEL and QFA R
      - [X] Write the logistic model equation
      - [X] I mention MDR so explain this as well
    - [X] Contrast QFA with SGA
    - [ ] Previous results (?) and follow up (Holstein &
      Clark) - Check which results were actually followed up.
  - [-] Explain the motivation for a nutrient diffusion model and
    current support for an effect
    - [X] At the same time, introduce P15 and the Stripes and Filled
      plates but wait until the methods to describe in these
      experiments in more detail.
    - [ ] Briefly mention alternative hypotheses (e.g. singal,
      metabolism) or wait until discussion? I will mention metabolism
      when I explain the approximations of the competition model. I
      think that I should probably mention signal and metabolism here
      if I have room.
  - [X] Describe previous attempts to correct for competition and how
    our approach differs
  - [X] Describe previous attempts to model diffusion (Diffusion
    equation model of Reo and Korolev 2014)
    - I am planning to talk about this in the discussion so could
      introduce here and also explain why we need a less detailed
      model (limits of computational power).
  - [-] Introduce the Competition model
    - [X] Mass action kinetics and network diffusion
    - [X] Reaction and rate equations
    - [X] No numerical solution
    - [X] Cells observed; nutrients hidden
    - [X] Explain the plate and culture level parameters.
    - [X] Explain that there are fewer parameters than in the logistic
      model.
    - [X] Explain what is measureable and what we must infer. kn? C_0
      often below detectable level in QFA - write here or elsewhere?
      We explain how we infer N_0 when we talk about initial guessing.
    - [-] Justify approximations
      - [X] Mass action kinetics
      - [X] Network diffusion
      - [X] Deterministic not stochastic
      - [ ] All nutrients are converted to cells
	- [ ] Implies all cultures starting with the same amount of
          nutrients end with the same amount of cells. ->
          Mention metabolism
    - [ ] Reduces to the logistic equivalent model in the independent limit
      - [ ] Can be seen as a correction for nutrient diffusion
      - [ ] Conversion equations (Not planning to inculude the full
        derivation - Link to Conor's blog?)
      - [ ] With same plate level parameters b rank is equivalent to r
        rank (also MDR and MDR*MDP) and K is constant.
  - [ ] Briefly explain what we plan to do with the model
    - Fit to data to try to estimate growth parameters more reliably
  - [ ] Short summary
    - More reliable measurement of growth parameters ->
    - More reliable fitness estimates ->
    - Better prediction of genetic interaction or drug response

I could also say - We hope that a model could be used to
compare/improve experimental design by simulation of
e.g. randomisation / SGA v QFA and dilute vs concentrated. I could
just say this in one line but I imagine that the above will already
take a fair amount of space and we haven't found that yet. Perhaps at
the end of the discussion.

* Methods

** TODO Tools, solving, and fitting [0/5]
  - [ ] I wrote the code in python
  - [ ] Data analysed using Colonyzer (Python)
  - [ ] Solving
    - [ ] scipy.odeint -> optimized by vectorizing and using numpy
    - [ ] libroadrunner
  - [ ] Writing models using libSBML
  - [ ] Fitting the Competition Model
    - [ ] SciPy's scipy.optimize.minimize (optimization and rootfinding package)
    - [ ] QFA R package for logistic model
    - [ ] Should I talk about the Development Process? (i.e. use of
      simulations and zones; determining tolerances)

** TODO Parameter Conversion [0/9]  # could go in or after fitting
  - [ ] When kn = 0 reduces to logistic model with same solution
  - [ ] Can equate models
  - [ ] Conversion equation
  - [ ] Mass action logistic assumes all nutrients go to cells and
    needs culture level N_0 to be fit.
  - [ ] Can be seen as a correction to the logistic model
  - [ ] Correction Figure
  - [ ] We can convert between models to compare fitness estimates
    directly.
  - [ ] b rank is proportional to r MDR and MDP
  - [ ] b as a fitness estimate

** TODO Initail Guess [0/4]
  # I was debating putting the imaginary neighbour model in the
  # introduction or splitting the model and fitting between the
  # introduction and methods. I now think that this should all go in
  # the methods. Been as this is a masters disertation I think it
  # should be alright to have a couple of figures in the methods.
  - [ ] N_0 can be inferred from final cell amounts
  - [ ] Explain the Imaginary neighbour model
    - [ ] Include a schematic
    - [ ] I have come up with a model for quickly fitting individual
      cultures to get appoximate estimates of b.
    - [ ] It is based on the competition model we already have.
    - [ ] We fit cell data for each culture individually
      - Solve using scipy.odeint
      - Fit using scipy.optimize.minimize and least squares
    - [ ] Places imaginary fast growing and empty cultures next to the
      culture of interest
    - [ ] We use the same number, n, of each of these. This could be
      eight in total to represent, for instance, 4 fast growing
      neighbours or 4 slow growing neighbours.
    - [ ] The value of n to use can be determined by the ratio of
      final cell amount to initial nutrient amount.
    - [ ] Fix N_0 and the growth constants of both neighbours. We have
      to use a grid of fixed C_0 values and take the best fit.
    - [ ] Allow k1, k2, and b to vary. b is the growth constant for
      the culture of interest.
    - [ ] We can also try different values of b_fast for fits of each
      culture to approximate different neighbour configurations.
    - [ ] Main difference is in having two kn's (k1 and k2) which we
      allow to vary freely.
  - [ ] Guessing k_n from b distiribution
    - [ ] I have a plot which demonstrates this which can go here or
      in the results. I think that it would be clearer to put it here.
  - [ ] Performance of imaginary neighbour guessing (plot of fit) can
    wait until the results.
