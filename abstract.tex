\textbf{Motivation:}~The fitness of microbial strains can be estimated
from the growth of cultures inoculated onto solid agar. In
high-throughput procedures, an array of cultures is grown on the same
agar plate and competition for nutrients between cultures is likely to
affect growth. However, analysis assumes that cultures grow
independently. We test a model of nutrient dependent growth and
diffusion and try to
correct for competition to provide more accurate and reliable fitness estimates.\\
\textbf{Results:}~What should we say?\\
\textbf{Availability and Implementation:}~CANS, a Python2 package developed for the analysis in this paper, is freely available from github pypi.\\

fuelled by nutrients which must diffuse through the agar (chop).) In
