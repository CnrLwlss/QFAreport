evolutionary fitness of microbial organisms and an excellent surrogate
for cell health.

In the high-throughput procedures QFA and SGA, microbial cultures are
inoculated in an array on solid agar, and growth is measured to obtain
quantitative fitness estimates.

Neighbouring cultures, which are often different genetic strains,
consume nutrients at different rates, creating gradients in nutrient
density. We believe that diffusion of nutrients between cultures is
affecting growth in these experiments. Current analysis does not
account for this; instead, it is assumed that cultures grow
independently. I use a network model of nutrient diffusion and
nutrient-dependent growth, to correct for competition, to try to
improve the accuracy and precision of fitness estimates. I test the
model against QFA data from studies on telomere function in
\textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}. Ultimately, the model might be used
to improve the reliability of screens for genetic interaction and drug
sensitivity.

% \textbf{Motivation:}~Growth rate is a major component of the
% evolutionary fitness of microbial organisms.~When nutrients are
% plentiful, fast-growing strains come to dominate populations whereas
% slower-growing strains are wiped out. Maintaining growth rate is
% therefore a priority for cell lineages and this makes growth rate an
% excellent surrogate for the health of cells. Measuring the health of
% cells grown in different genetic backgrounds or environments can
% inform about genetic interaction and drug sensitivity. In
% high-throughput procedures such as QFA and SGA, arrays of microbial
% cultures are grown on solid agar plates and quantitative fitness
% estimates are determined from growth measurements. Diffusion of
% nutrients along gradients in nutrient density arising between fast-
% and slow-growing neighbours is likely to affect growth rate and
% fitness estimates. However, current analyses assume that cultures grow
% independently. I study data from QFA experiments growing
% \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} to test a mass action kinetic model
% of nutrient dependent growth and diffusion across a network. I try to
% correct for competition to provide more accurate and precise fitness
% estimates to allow more accurate and precise genetic interaction and
% drug screens.
% \\
\textbf{Results:}~I fit the competition model to a QFA plate from
\citet{Addinall2011}.
% The plate is inoculated with dilute cultures
% and strains have deletions in genes relevant to telomere function.
Using far fewer parameters (387 vs 1152), the new model fits
timecourses with similar closeness to the previous model.
% The fit is much closer for at least some fast growing strains.
Fitness estimates are less precise for the fastest growing strains,
but more precise for the majority of strains (36 out of 50). Fitness
rankings agree in the positions of the fastest and slowest growing
strains, but disagree in the middle positions.
% The positions of the fastest and slowest growing strains also agree
% with independent spot tests in published papers. Independent data is
% not available to resolve the disagreement in middle rankings.
In a cross-plate validation experiment,
% using QFA plates with a higher inoculum density,
the competition model overestimates timecourses to a similar degree
that the previous model underestimates. A different method of fitting
is required to find globally optimal solutions which might improve
reliability.

% \textbf{Results:}~Using far fewer parameters (387 vs 1152), the
% proposed model fits timecourses from a 384-format QFA plate inoculated
% with dilute cultures with a similar accuracy to a current QFA
% model. Accuracy is improved for fast growing strains. Fitness rankings
% of strains on the same plate agree with a previous QFA study and
% independent experiments in the positions of the fastest and slowest
% growing strains, but disagree for medium growing strains. Estimates
% are less presise for the fastest growing strains, but more precise for
% 36 out of 50 strains. In cross plate callibration and validation,
% using QFA plates with a higher inoculum density, the model
% overcorrects for competition effects to a similar degree that current
% models undercorrect. A different method of fitting is required to find
% globally optimal solutions.
