\textbf{Motivation:}~Growth rate is a major component of the
evolutionary fitness of microbial organisms.~When nutrients are
plentiful, fast-growing strains come to dominate populations whereas
slower-growing strains are wiped out. This makes growth rate an
excellent (a useful) surrogate for the health of cells. Measuring the
health of cells grown in different genetic backgrounds or environments
can inform about genetic interaction and drug sensitivity. In
high-throughput procedures such as QFA and SGA, arrays of microbial
cultures are grown on solid agar plates and quantitative fitness
estimates are determined from growth measurements. Diffusion of
nutrients along gradients in nutrient density arising between fast-
and slow-growing neighbours is likely to affect growth rate and
fitness estimates. However, current analyses assume that cultures grow
independently. We study data from QFA experiments growing
\textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} to test a mass action kinetic model
of nutrient dependent growth and diffusion. We try to correct for
competition to provide more accurate and precise fitness estimates.
